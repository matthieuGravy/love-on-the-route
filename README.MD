**PanicMode** is a small package currently under development, designed to simplify the creation of static sites. It allows for easy loading of Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components, while avoiding the complexity of heavier frameworks like React. This is particularly useful for small projects that need a lightweight and accessible solution.

The goal of this project is to provide a developer-friendly package that enables fast prototyping without getting bogged down by complicated configurations. PanicMode is ideal for those who want to focus on building, rather than configuring.

## Install the package

```sh
npm i panicmode
```
